Congratulations on completing the 'Boat race' project! Would you like to try something a little more challenging?

You could try out the [Memory](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/projects/memory?utm_source=pathway&utm_medium=whatnext&utm_campaign=projects) project.

\--- no-print \--- Click on the green flag to start. Watch the sequence of colours shown by the dancer's dress and listen to the accompanying drum beats, then repeat the colours back to her. If you get the colours' order wrong, it's game over!
