目前游戏*太过*简单--让我们增加些难度提高一下游戏的乐趣。

Let's first add some 'boosts' to your game to speed up the boat. Edit your stage backdrop and add in some white booster arrows.

Now add some code to your boat's forever loop so that it moves three extra steps when it touches a white booster.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- `If` your boat is `touching a white booster`, then it should `move 3 extra steps`.  
\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![screenshot](images/boat-boost-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-boost-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

You can also add a spinning gate which your boat will have to avoid. Add a new sprite called 'gate' that looks like this:

Add code to your gate to make it spin slowly forever.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Add code to the gate sprite so that it `turns 1 degree` `forever`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![screenshot](images/boat-spin-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here's what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-spin-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---
