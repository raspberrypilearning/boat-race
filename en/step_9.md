## What can you do now?

Try our [More Scratch 2](https://projects.raspberrypi.org/en/pathways/scratch-module-2) project pathway where you will create a memory game.

Click on the green flag to start. Watch the sequence of colours shown by the dancer's dress and listen to the accompanying drum beats, then repeat the colours back to her. If you get the colours' order wrong, it's game over!
