## Winning!

--- task ---

When the boat gets to the island, the game should say 'YEAH!', and then it should end.

Add more code blocks inside your `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop so that your code keeps checking if the player has won:

Here's what your new code should look like:

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
if <touching color [#FFFF99] ?> then
say [YEAH!] for (2) seconds
stop [all v]
end
```

Don't forget that this new code needs to be inside the `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop.
