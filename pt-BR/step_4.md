## Controlling the boat

\--- task \---

Você vai controlar o barco com o mouse. Adicione o código ao seu barco para que ele comece no canto inferior esquerdo apontando para cima e siga o ponteiro do mouse. ** Teste seu código ** para se certificar de que ele faz o que é esperado dele.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- Quando a bandeira verde ` é clicada ` , você precisará fazer o seu barco ` ir para a posição inicial ` e ` apontar para cima ` . Next it will need to `point towards the mouse pointer` and `move 1 step`. It will need to repeat this `forever`.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need: ![screenshot](images/boat-move-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- This is what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-move-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

\--- task \---

Test out your boat by clicking the flag and moving the mouse. Does the boat sail towards the mouse?

**Note:** There is currently a bug in Scratch which means your boat may not move towards the mouse pointer. If this happens, click the arrow on the `point towards` block and re-select `mouse-pointer`.

What happens if the boat reaches the mouse pointer? Try it.

To stop this from happening, you'll need to add an `if` block to your code, so that the boat only moves if it is more than 5 pixels away from the mouse.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \--- The boat should only point towards the mouse pointer and move `if` the `distance to the mouse pointer` is `greater than 5 pixels`. \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- Here are the code blocks you'll need to add to the code for the boat: ![screenshot](images/boat-pointer-blocks.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- hint \--- This is what your code should look like: ![screenshot](images/boat-pointer-code.png) \--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

Test out your boat again to check whether the problem has been fixed.
