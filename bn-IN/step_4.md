## Crashing!

At the moment, the boat sprite can simply sail through the wooden barriers! You're going to fix that now.

\--- task \---

You need two costumes for your boat sprite: one normal costume, and one for when the boat crashes. Duplicate your boat sprite's costume, and name one costume 'normal' and the other 'hit'.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

Click on your 'hit' costume, and use the **Select** tool to grab pieces of the costume and move and rotate them to make the boat look like it has crashed to pieces.

Now add code to your boat so that it crashes and breaks up when it touches any brown wooden barriers.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \---

You need to add code blocks inside your `forever`{:class="block3control"} loop so that your code keeps checking if the boat sprite has crashed, and if it has crashed, the code needs to reset the boat sprite's position.

`if`{:class="block3control"} the boat is `touching`{:class="block3sensing"} the brown colour of the wood, you need to `switch to the hit costume`{:class="block3looks"}, `say Noooo! for 2 seconds`{:class="block3looks"}, and then `switch back to the normal costume`{:class="block3looks"}. Finally, you'll need to `point up`{:class="block3motion"} and `go to the start position`{:class="block3motion"}.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here are the code blocks you need:

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
if <touching color [ ] ?> then
end

go to x: (-190) y: (-150)

switch costume to (hit v)

point in direction (0)

switch costume to (normal v)

say [Noooooo!] for (2) seconds
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

Here's what your code should look like:

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x: (-190) y: (-150)
forever
if <(distance to (mouse-pointer v)) > [5]> then
point towards (mouse-pointer v)
move (1) steps
end
if <touching color [#663b00] ?> then
switch costume to (hit v)
say [Noooooo!] for (2) seconds
switch costume to (normal v)
point in direction (0)
go to x: (-190) y: (-150)
end
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- /hints \---

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

You should also add code to make sure that your boat sprite always starts out looking 'normal'.

Test your code again. If you try to sail the boat through a wooden barrier now, the boat should crash and then move back to its starting position.
