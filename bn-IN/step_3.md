## Controlling the boat

The player will control the boat sprite with the mouse.

\--- task \---

Add code to the boat sprite so that it starts in the bottom left-hand corner pointing up and then follows the mouse pointer.

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x: (-190) y: (-150)
forever
point towards (mouse-pointer v)
move (1) steps
```

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

**Test your code** by clicking the green flag and moving the mouse. Does the boat sprite move towards the mouse pointer?

\--- task \---

What happens when the boat reaches the mouse pointer? Try it out to see what the problem is.

\--- /task \---

\--- task \---

To stop this from happening, you need to add an `if`{:class="block3control"} block to your code, so that the boat sprite only moves if it is more than 5 pixels away from the mouse pointer.

\--- hints \--- \--- hint \---

The boat should only point towards the mouse pointer and move `if`{:class="block3control"} the `distance to the mouse pointer`{:class="block3sensing"} is `greater than 5 pixels`{:class="block3operators"}.

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

These are the code blocks you need to add to the code for the boat sprite:

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
if < [ ] > [ ] > then

(distance to (mouse-pointer v))
```

\--- /hint \--- \--- hint \---

This is what your code should look like:

![boat-sprite](images/boat_resize.png)

```blocks3
when flag clicked
point in direction (0)
go to x: (-190) y: (-150)
forever
if <(distance to (mouse-pointer v)) > [5]> then
point towards (mouse-pointer v)
move (1) steps
```

Test your code again to check whether the problem is now fixed.
